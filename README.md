## Features
- **Accurate Classification**: Uses a fine-tuned Xception model for high accuracy in detecting brain tumors.
- **User-Friendly Web Application**: Built with Flask to allow easy image upload and immediate results.
- **End-to-End Solution**: From model training to deployment, the entire pipeline is integrated.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Provides quick and reliable predictions for uploaded MRI images.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- Python 
- TensorFlow
- Flask
- Pillow (PIL)
- NumPy

### Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/owais-mazhar/brain-tumor-classification.git
   cd brain-tumor-classification
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the pre-trained model**:
   - Place the `bt_model.h5` file in the project directory.

## Usage
To start the web application and use the model for predictions, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Flask application**:
   ```bash
   python brain_tumor.py
   ```

2. **Open your web browser** and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

3. **Upload an MRI image** and get the prediction.

### Example
1. Navigate to the home page.
2. Click on "Choose File" to upload an MRI image.
3. Click on "Predict" to get the classification result.

## Results
The model achieved 100% accuracy on the test dataset, showcasing its potential for real-world applications. Users can rely on the web application for quick and accurate brain tumor detection from MRI images.

## Challenges
During the development of this project, several challenges were encountered:
- **Data Imbalance**: Addressed by applying data augmentation techniques.
- **Model Complexity**: Managed by utilizing cloud-based GPU resources for training.
- **Web Integration**: Ensured smooth operation by carefully handling image preprocessing and prediction logic.

## Future Work
- **Scalability**: Deploy the application on cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud.
- **Additional Features**: Incorporate patient history tracking, detailed reports, and integration with EHR systems.
- **Model Improvements**: Continuously update the model with new data for better generalization.
